import SwiftUI

/// A view that wraps `Content` in unary view.
///
/// Most views such as `ZStack`, `VStack` and `HStack` are
/// unary views. This means they would produce a single subview
/// if transformed by a ``VariadicViewAdapter``.  This is contrary
/// to `ForEach`, `TupleView`, `Section` and `Group` which
/// would produce multiple subviews. This different in behaviour can be
/// crucial, as it impacts: layout, how a view is modified by a `ViewModifier`,
/// and performance.
///
/// > Tip: In most cases you shouldn't need to use ``UnaryViewAdaptor``,
/// but it can help fix rare performance problems or layout crashes.
///
/// For example a unary view will result in a single subview when used as
/// the source for a ``VariadicViewAdapter``. Whereas a `TupleView`
/// would result in N subviews, one for each element in the tuple.
